In Sourcetree, the sidebar to your left indicates which branch or version of the mod you're currently using and also shows available branches you may switch to.

The above image shows that I'm currently running on the default - main branch of the mod (highlighted in yellow)\
Highlighted in purple is the dev branch, which is available to remotely download / checkout.

And now, under branches you can see that we have both the dev & main branches available and currently we've chosen the dev branch as default. _(The bot folder in your pc automatically changes / updates files according to the branch you select. It is synced)_
