# Using MyBotRun xbebenk

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If you haven't launched MyBotRun before, there will not be a "profiles" folder in the directory where you pulled the files from Sourcetree. It is recommended that you follow the instructions for "Single Session" if this is your first time using the bot.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order for MyBotRun to work properly with a Town Hall 3 account, it must have at least 70 capacity _Army Camps_. This can be achieved by upgrading two Army Camps to level 3. **NOTE:** The game provides enough gems to upgrade everything needed to prepare your account for MyBotRun, make sure to do so before running the bot.
