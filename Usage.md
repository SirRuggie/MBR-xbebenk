# The Usage guide to MyBotRun xbebenk
MyBotRun can be launched multiple different ways depending on how you'd like to use it and how many accounts you have connected.   
**Note:** If you have not launched MyBotRun before, there will not be a profiles folder in the directory where you pulled from Sourcetree. 
It is recommended that you follow the below step under Single Session if this is the first time.
